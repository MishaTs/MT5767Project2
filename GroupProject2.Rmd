### Introduction

The wildebeest (*Connochaetes*) live and move in large herds [@estes2014]. The blue wildebeest (*Connochaetes taurinus*) migrate in a clockwise manner from Serengeti, Tanzania to Masai Mara, Kenya, forming the backbone of the Great Migration in south-eastern Africa [@estes2014]. During this annual crossing of great distances, the blue wildebeest follow annual rain cycles and move along its trajectory. The species also breeds annually, dependent on rainfall [@estes2014]. Due to expansion of agriculture, Rinderpest induced by the spread of cattle-farming, and poaching pressure, this antelope species's abundance steeply declined in the 1960s and 70s. Since then, population monitoring has been a key focus of biologists and conservationists. 

This report used 1960--1989 measures of wildebeest populations [sourced from @css2023] to construct a Bayesian state-space model, analyse species population size and growth including years lacking survey data, and project population trajectories five years into the future. 

### Methodology

##### Ecological modelling

A state-space model (SSM) consists of two components: an unobserved "true" population process, $N_t$, and the observation process, $y_t$, that often entails observation process errors and uncertainties. Here, true wildebeest population $N_t$ depends on the population growth rate, $\lambda_t$, that has been accounted for yearly removals from poaching, $c_t$. Variables can either be deterministic (i.e., $=$) or stochastic (i.e., $\sim$); deterministic values can be perfectly calculated from the right hand of the equation with no variation while stochastic values include natural, statistical variation often represented by known distributions (e.g., normal, poisson, binomial). To account for random variation common in natural systems, large $N_{t+1}$s take a normal distribution consistent with the millions of wildebeest observed more suitable to a continuous distribution. $$N_{t+1} \sim N(\lambda_t*(N_t - c_t), sigma^2_t)$$

$\lambda_t$, i.e., $\frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t}$, depends on rainfall $R_t$ as suggested by @estes2014. To test this relation, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ estimate $log({\lambda_t})$, a logarithmic transformation allowing for (i) only positive $\lambda$ values, (ii) estimation of the per-capita growth rate $r_t = log_e(\lambda_t) = \frac{\Delta{N}}{N\Delta{t}}$, and (iii) more easy interpretation of the relationship with $\beta$s. $$log(\lambda_t) = \beta_0 + \beta_1*R_t$$

Finally, population measures $y_t$ are treated as normally distributed and unbiased with an associated known spread of values ${se}_t$. Thus, they correspond to a simple stochastic normal distribution linked to the underlying true state $N_t$. $$y_t \sim N(N_t, se_t^2)$$ 

These three equations are the likelihoods estimated by Bayesian methods.

#### Bayesian analysis

Implemented in RStudio Environment [@Rbase] using a JAGS user interface package [@kellner2021], Bayesian analysis updates pre-existing knowledge about parameters, the prior distribution $p(\theta)$, with estimates derived from observed data, a likelihood function $p(y|\theta)$. These generate parameter estimates as a posterior distribution, $p(\theta|y)$ [@van2021]. In contrast to classical statistics generating estimates as single values, Bayesian analyses describe parameters as full distributions [@kery2011]. These all derive from Bayes' rule. $$p(\theta|y) = \frac{p(y|\theta)*p(\theta)}{p(y)}$$
$p(y)$ does not dependent on any parameter $\theta$ and is treated as an omitted normalising factor [@van2021]. Thus, the Bayesian approach simplies to deriving the posterior from existing priors and an estimated likelihood $p(\theta|y) \varpropto p(y|\theta)* p(\theta)$.

For all estimated parameters, Bayesian methods require specifying prior beliefs about the variables of interest (commonly as statistical distributions). $log(\lambda_t)$ deterministically [@kellner2021] depended on $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, feeding into an $N_{t+1}$ including variation $sigma_t$. $\beta$ priors centred on 0 (suggesting no relationship) with a large, normal spread in values to minimally influence estimates. Thus, non-zero estimates of growth rates clearly derive from the data.
$$\beta_0, \beta_1 \sim N(0, 1000)$$
$\sigma$ priors appear small but represent the millions scale (the same as observations $y_t$); they must be positive due to statistical principles. Thus, the true population may vary uniformly anywhere between 0 and 1 million wildebeest. $$\sigma_t \sim U(0, 1)$$
Finally, initial population size $N_1$ also used a prior consistent with the observations uniformly between 0 and 0.7 (e.g., 700 000 wildebeest)---larger than any observed abundance before 1970. $$N_1 \sim U(0, 0.7)$$
All variance terms (i.e., $\sigma^2_t$, and $se_t^2$) were input as precision, $\tau = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}$, to JAGS code.

#### Model estimation

Bayesian analysis consisted of six steps: writing models in JAGS, packaging data, setting initial values, defining parameters of interest, simulating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) values, and posterior predictive checking. Our priors of interest were $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $sigma^2_t$, and our latent variables were growth rate and estimated population size (in millions). Markov chains are a iterative process where a value in $t+1$ is only related to the value of its $t$ step. Monte Carlo is a stochastic simulation procedure to determine integrals by simulating random numbers from a given distribution. In MCMC settings, we ran three different chains. To deal with the value autocorrelation, we dropped the every sixth value in the MCMC run. MCMC used 200 000 total iterations, half of which were discarded to "burn-in" the model. Posterior checks used trace plots to visually detect convergence supported with Bruce-Gelman-Rubin (BGR) $\hat{R}$ statistics. Given assumed unbiased observations with known observation error, posterior predictive checking was deemed unnecessary.

To deal with N/A values (i.e., years without survey), @achim2005 back-filled initial $N_t$ values derived from $y_t$ to initialise the model. However, only years with observations were used in likelihood settings to baseline against $y_t$ in the observation process. @casey2018 was followed for MCMC checks and @ggplot for graphs.

### Results and Discussion

First, model convergence from BGR statistics of three main parameters illustrated high confidence in results (Table \@ref(tab:parameterVals)). Mean $\sigma_t$, estimated around `r round(mean(wildeout1$mean$sig.r),2)`, seems small but pertains to a typical spread of 40 000 wildebeest that can be equivalent to the maximum annual removal. As the 95% credible interval (CI) excluded 0, the model concluded a 95% chance of some non-zero variation in the true population, and data supported the inclusion of a stochastic term in the true population. In contrast, mean $\beta_0$ suggested 9.6% population growth in years with no rain that decreased by mean $\beta_1$ 0.02% with each additional mm of rainfall $R_t$. However, the 95% CIs included zero indicating that rainfall may actually not influence population growth rates. The current model opted for density-independent growth lacking terms like carrying capacity $K$. This alternative approach may capture the true effect of rainfall more strongly.

Figure \@ref(fig:tracePlot) visually confirms convergence and graphically represents the distributions of the three parameters. $\beta$s appeared broadly normal following from the specified priors, and both centred quite close to zero: chains explored possible values well including extreme options after 130 000 iterations. Notably, chain starting values were tightly constrained, and the model was quite sensitive to prior specification. The Jenkins prior, a type of diffuse prior, and other uninformative options may be good to test the suitability of other formulations for prior predictive checking. Additionally, priors around zero closely matched analogous classical inference strategies using null hypotheses. $\sigma_t$ more consistently traversed possible values given its limitation to positive values and provided an apparently log-normal posterior distribution with a narrow left tail excluding zero; the diffuse uniform prior suggests strong confidence in these results. The selected 100 000 burn-in seemed excessive with relatively quick chain convergence. But, the presence of large jumps implied the converse: parameter variance may actually increase with longer chains. Thus, the selected formation was a reasonable middle ground between these two considerations. 

The initial population size, $N_1$, strongly depended on sensible starting values to initialise simulations. Thus, an explicit specification of biological realism is imperative. Such simulation outputs would benefit conservation of wildebeest populations. Autocorrelation remains a consistent issue with these data: parameters strongly correlate across iterations. The thinning approach undertaken could not solve the issue. Future potential solutions include more aggressive thinning or other hierarchical approaches (e.g., model reformulation).

Looking into future projections (1990-1994), the SSM matched well with observed data under the constraints of a exponential population growth (Figure \@ref(fig:projectedValues)). The true range of $N_t$ did not perfectly match estimated $y_t$ or its spread $se_t$. Mean estimated $N_t$ fell within the 95% confidence interval of the observed data, as expected given imperfect biological surveys. The coherence of mean estimated $N_t$ with observation error $se_t$ confirmed SSM output values correctly. $y_t$ and $N_t$ matched well before 1972 but the former more freely approximated the latter in the final decade of surveying. Projections assumed illegal poaching remains at 1989 values and 1.49 mm dry season rainfall; under these conditions, wildebeest populations were projected to consistently exceed 1.3 million and approach 2 million individuals by 1994. Given missing observations, the 95% CI was quite wide and suggested a potential 2.5 million wildebeest in 1994.

Population growth rates were consistent to varying degrees (mean estimates 1.05--1.10) (Figure \@ref(fig:lambdaPlot)). Understandably, the 95% CI showed higher uncertainty during un-surveyed years compared to years surveyed. The CIs occasionally and only slightly crossed the threshold of decreased growth (< 1). Estimates were constant for projected years due to no reference survey data: Wildebeest populations may grow by 7.1% [3.2%, 9.7%] starting in 1990. In short, the high $\lambda$s suggest little threat of population extinction over the survey period or during short-run projections and confirm that wildebeest will remain stable.

The SSM imperfectly supports other empirical results like a rainfall relationship and suggests that exponential growth may be a sub-optimal assumption. Even so, SSMs can approximate observed populations well and serve a strong tool in conservation ecology.

### Authors' Contributions
To master understanding Bayesian analysis and writing in JAGS environment, MT and MA wrote and completed running their own separate models. MT coded four models, and MA coded one model. Authors agreed upon one and built their report around it. For report writing, the sections were distributed equally (MA = introduction and methodology; MT = result and discussion) in the first draft compilation. Following these steps and beyond, collaborative discussion and editing was done at each step. So much so, to select the writing media for the report (i.e., Rmarkdown or Word doc), an unbiased coin mediated decisions. Both authors reviewed the materials and agreed to the submitted version. For more detail on individual contributions, please reference \href{https://github.com/MishaTs/MT5767Project2/}{GitHub}.
